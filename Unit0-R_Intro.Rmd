# Intro to RStudio


```{r, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mosaic))
```

Welcome to our RStudio Introduction! RStudio is a front end (user friendly) interface for R, a programming
language for statistics.  We’ll be using it to work with data and our various forms of functions.


RStudio is a **long term learning goal** for us. We will be adding new functions and learning new
things throughout the semester.


## Getting Started

Follow my lead as we get ourselves going with RStudio. We will

* Log in to RStudio
* Add some *packages* to the R environment
* Create a math135 directory to work in
* Create our first Rmd ('R Markdown') file
* Knit that Rmd file to create a PDF

You will need to replace the auto-generated code block at the top of your Rmd file with this one, which loads the mosaic functionality into the R environment when we knit to PDF.

````
```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mosaic))
```
````

**Pro Tip:** Be kind to future you. 

* Save all of your work for this class in the `math135` subdirectory that we create today.
* Give your files meaningful names. Include the unit, the topic,  the date, etc, or a helpful combination of these identifiers.


## R Markdown files

An R Markdown file is a hybrid file that has both text and code. You can then **knit** this Rmd file to make a lovely PDF.

### Formatting Regular Text

The regular text uses Markdown, which has simple commands to create formatting such has sections, bold, italic, links, itemized lists, and much more. Here are is some example Markdown syntax.

```
# Heading 

This is a regular sentence.

## Sub Heading

You get *italics like this.* 

Skipping a line starts a new paragraph.
But if you don't skip a line then it's part of the same paragraph

### Sub Sub Heading

You get **bold text like this.**

Here is how to make an itemized list

* Make sure to skip a line before your first item
* The asterisk must be the **first** character on the line (no spaces!)
* If you want a sublist
   + Start the sublist on the line below the item
   + Indent by three spaces.
   + Use a plus sign

```

Here is a nice reference page for [common R Markdown syntax](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html).


### Code Chunks

Your R code must be placed inside **code chunks.** Here is what a code chuck looks like

````
```{r}`r ''`
1 + 1

sin(pi/4)
```
````

When you knit your Rmd file, the code chunks are executed in order. You can also 
run an individual chunk by clicking on the green arrow in its upper right corner.


Adding a code chunk is easy!

* In the top bar of the Markdown window, there’s a small, green plus C button.
* When you click this button, it’ll bring up options for code blocks to insert
* Select "R" which is the first option. (It's the only one we will use.)


## Writing Code

Add a code chunk and let's get cracking! 


### Basic Calculations
We can use that code chunk to do some basic calculations.


#### You Try

Create a code block and try to calculate each of the following. Try some other calculations, too!

* $8+13$
* $7*9$
* $\sin(\pi/2)$
* $\sqrt{121}$
* $(2.25)^3$
* $8 \cos( \pi/6)$

Which ones work? If you got an error, can you fix it? Can you guess the name of the square root function?


### Variables, Lists and Sequences

When we do a calculation, we can store the result for later. Here are some examples:

```{r echo=TRUE}
a = 15
b = 4 * a

```
  
R is particularly good at doing calculations on lists of data. So let's make some lists!

RStudio makes a list with the `c()` command. The "c" in short for "combine".

```{r}
P=c(3, 5, 11, -1, 4)
P
```

If you want to make a sequence, you use the `seq()` command. For example:


```{r, echo=TRUE}
S=seq(1, 10)
S
```


Notice that the values increment by 1. You can use a different step size by adding a third argument.
For exmaple, if I wanted a sequence 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc... all the way up to 2, I would write

```{r, echo=TRUE}
T=seq(1, 2, 0.1)
T
```

Now look at the **Environment** tab in the upper right window. What do you notice?


**Pro Tips**: Be kind to future you as well as current collaborators.

* Always write `0.1` instead of `.1` in your code. It is much easier to read and to debug later!
* Consider adding a space after your commas to separate parameters. It's easier to read!


#### You Try

Try to do the following:

* Create a list `X` containing the values 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9.
* Create a list `Y` containing the sequence of odd integers between (and including) 1 and 19
* What is the output of the command `X^2'? Can you see what R is doing?
* Try making another lists. Apply some functions to that list.


### Functions

Now it's time to write your own function. Here is how you create $f(x)= x^2 -3$. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
f = makeFun(x^2 - 3 ~ x)
```

Much of this is pretty intuitive, except for maybe the final `~ x`. This tilde symbol comes up a lot in RStudio and it indicates *dependence*. We need to tell RStudio that $f$ is in terms of this variable $x$, so it knows where to put an input when I ask it to.


Notice! In the right upper window, you now have a function called `f`. We can do a lot with this function, but
to start, let’s evaluate it at 1.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
f(1)
```

What do you think this code is doing?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
S=seq(1, 10)
f(S)
```


#### You Try

* Create a new function $g$ where $g(t) = \sqrt{t-4}$
* Evaluate this function at $t=8$, and $t=12.34$ and $t=100$
* What happens when you try to evaluate this function at $t=2$? What do you think that means?



### Plotting


Let's see how to create plots using RStudio. First, let's create a plot of this data

  |   |   |   |   |   |
--|---|---|---|---|---|---
x | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
h(x) | 0 | 1 |  4 | 9  | 16 | 25

from the function $h(x)=x^2$.


```{r, echo=TRUE}

X = seq(0,5)
Y = X^2
plotPoints(Y ~ X)
```

Notice! We list the **dependent** variable `Y` first and then the **independent** variable `X` after the tidle `~` (which matches the syntax of `makeFun`).

We can also plot a function. Once again the dependent variable appears after the tilde.

```{r, echo=TRUE}


plotFun(x^2 ~ x)
```


We can actually plot the data and the function on the same graph. We will plot the data and then add the function by using the  `add=TRUE` parameter for `plotFun`. I will also use the optional `col` parameter to change the color of the function curve.


```{r, echo=TRUE}

plotPoints(Y ~ X)
plotFun(x^2 ~ x, add=TRUE, col='red')
```

#### You Try

* Create a sequence of integer points `P` from 1 to 10.
* Define `Q = sin(P)`
* Create a plot of `Q` versus `P` and then add the function plot of `sin(x)`
* Try plotting some other data and fuunctions.

## Troubleshooting

Without fail, you will make mistakes. Things will break and you’ll get error messages. That’s ok! That’s how
we learn.

### You Try 

Each of the following lines of code will break when run. Try them out, notice the error, and see if
you can fix it.

* `2 sin(pi/2)`
* `sqrt(3*(7+5)`
* `Sqrt(3*(7+5))`
* `makeFun(x^2-4, x)`
* `makeFun(x+1 ~ t)`
* `makefun(2x+1 ~ x)`
