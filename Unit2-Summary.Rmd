# Unit 2 Summary


## Dimensions and Units

I can ...

* Explain the difference between dimensions and units
* Identify the seven fundamental dimensions
* Look up the dimensions for various physical quantities such as velocity, acceleration and force.
* Find the dimension for a given formula
* Perform a unit conversion

## Dimensional Analysis

I can ...

* Determine whether an equation is dimensionally feasible (consistent) or dimensionally infeasible (inconsistent)
* Perform a dimensional analysis to guess the formula for a physical system, given the inputs and the output.

## Fermi Estimation

I can ...

* Find the order of magnitude of a number
* Estimate the order of magnitude of a simple quantity 
* Explain why 300 is a good choice to estimate a magnitude that is definitely bigger than 100 but less than 1000 
* Make a Fermi Estimation of a complicated quantity by making a sequence of simpler estimations.
