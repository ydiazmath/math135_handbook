Find an exponential model for the population. 7.2.2 Consumer price index The consumer price index (CPI) for a given year is the amount of money in that year that has the same purchasing power as $100 in 1983. At the start of 2009, the CPI was 211. Write a formula for the CPI as a function of \\(t\\) years after 2009, assuming the CPI increases by a rate of 2.8% every year. 7.2.3 Two data sets Here are approximate values of two functions. For each one, decide whether it could be a linear function or an exponential function. Give a reason and then find an approximate formula. \\(x\\) 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 \\(f(x)\\) 26.00 26.15 26.30 26.45 26.60 26.75 26.90 \\(g(x)\\) 190 217 247 282 321 366 418 7.2.4 Interest rate for an investment Suppose that an investment triples in 15 years. What is the interest rate \\(r\\) if the interest is compounded annually: \\(I(t) = I_0 (1+r)^t\\). What is the interest rate \\(r\\) if interest is compounded continuously: \\(I(t) = I_0 e^{rt}\\). Which rate is larger? Why does that make sense? 7.2.5 Exponential decay Radioactive cobalt-60 has a half-life of 5.3 years. If the initial amount is 60 grams, find a formula for the amount of cobalt-60 left after \\(t\\) years. 7.2.6 Doubling time The doubling time of an exponentially increasing function is the amount of time it takes for the quantity to double. Find the doubling time for the function \\(f(t) = 10 e^{1.2t}\\). 7.2.7 People and vehicles In 1980, there were about 170 million vehicles (cars and trucks) and about 227 million people in the United States. The number of vehicles has been growing at an annual rate of 4% a year, while the population has been growing at an annual rate of 1% a year. According to this model, when was there, on average, one vehicle per person? In desmos, make a plot of the number of vehicles and the number of people over time on the same graph with a different color for each curve. Use your models to predict the number of vehicles and the number of people in 2020. Then use Google to see how accurate these models are over time.
