Line with slope \\(m\\) and vertical intercept \\(b\\) \\[y = mx + b\\] Line with slope \\(m\\) and containing point \\((a,b)\\) \\[ (y-b) = m (x-a)\\] Line that contains points \\((a_1,b_1)\\) and \\((a_2,b_2)\\) \\[ (y-b_1) = \\frac{b_2 - b_1}{a_2 - a_1} (x - a_1)\\] 5.3 Activities 5.3.1 Graph of a linear function Find the equation \\(y=mx+b\\) for the graph shown below. 5.3.2 Height and weight of American men The table below lists the average weight, \\(w\\), in pounds of American men in their sixties for height, \\(h\\), in inches. Height (inches) 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 Weight (pounds) 166 171 176 181 186 191 196 201 Which is the dependent variable and which is the independent variable? Is this an increasing function or a decreasing function? Can this be represented by a linear function? If so, find an equation to describe this data. 5.3.3 Scooter rates A scooter company charges for monthly service according to the formula: \\[C(t) = 5.99 + 0.23 t\\] where \\(t\\) is the number of minutes minutes ridden. Find and interpret the rate of change and the vertical intercept. 5.3.4 Oil reserves There were 1650 billion barrels of proven oil reserves in the world as of 2016. At constant consumption levels (and excluding unproven reserves), the world had enough oil to last about 47 more years beyond 2016. Create a linear function \\(R(t)\\) that models the oil reserves (in billions of barrels) where \\(t\\) is the number of years since 2016. Find and interpret the rate of change and the vertical intercept of your function.
