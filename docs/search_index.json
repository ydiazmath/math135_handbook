So we need to make sure that this package has been loaded into RStudio. suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mosaicCalc)) Here is the code to create the slope field for \\(\\displaystyle{\\frac{dP}{dt} = 6 - 2 P}\\) vectorfield_plot(t ~ 1, P ~ 6 - 2 * P, bounds(t=-8:8, P=-8:8)) 39.2 Activities 39.2.1 Match the Slope Field Match each of the following differential equations with its slope field. Hint: start by setting \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\\) and solving for \\(y\\). The slopes along the resulting curve will always be horizontal. \\(\\displaystyle{\\frac{dy}{dx}=xy}\\) \\(\\displaystyle{\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{x}{y}}\\) \\(\\displaystyle{\\frac{dy}{dx}=x+y}\\) \\(\\displaystyle{\\frac{dy}{dx}=x-y}\\) Slope Field A Slope Field B Slope Field C Slope Field D 39.2.2 Draw Some Trajectories For each of the above slope fields, sketch the solution curves that satisfy \\(y(0) = 1\\) \\(y(0) = 0\\) \\(y(0) = -1\\) 39.2.3 Slope Fields for Population Models Create a slope field for each of the following population models. For each one, describe the long-term behavior for a variety of intial populations. For which initial values of \\(P\\) does the population increase without bound? stabilize to a constant value? die out? Exponential growth with harvesting. \\[ \\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.2 P - 40 \\] for \\(0 \\leq P \\leq 300\\) and \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 100\\).
