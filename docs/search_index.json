Fit a power function to data When you have data that you suspect comes from a power function \\[y=k x^p,\\] here is how you can find the constants \\(p\\) and \\(k\\) Take the natural log of both the \\(x\\)-axis data and the \\(y\\)-axis data Fit a line to the resulting data Use the slope and \\(y\\)-intercept of this line to find the values of the power \\(p\\) and the constant \\(k\\). 8.2 Activities 8.2.1 Examples and non-examples Determine whether each of the following is a power function \\(y=k x^p\\). If so, then find the leading constant \\(k\\) and the power \\(p\\). \\(y=5 \\cdot 3^x\\) \\(y = 10 \\sqrt{x}\\) \\(\\displaystyle{y = \\frac{7}{2x}}\\) \\(y = 9x^2 -2\\) \\(y = (4x)^3\\) 8.2.2 Descriptions of power functions Write a formula representing the function. The energy \\(E\\) expended by a swimming dolphin is proportional to the cube of its speed \\(v\\). The number \\(N\\) of animal species with body length \\(L\\) is inversely proportional to the square of the body length. 8.2.3 Allometry of pectoral fins Allometry is the study of the relative sizes of parts of an animal. Often, as an animal grows, the size of a body part will be a power function of its length. Here is a table of fish body lengths \\(L\\) and pectoral fin lengths \\(F\\). Body Length (cm) 6.35 7.03 8.17 9.03 9.21 9.39 9.58 11.59 Pectoral Fin Length (cm) 2.72 3.49 4.06 4.95 4.86 5.00 5.05 6.05 Create a log-log plot of this data and explain why this provides evidence that there is a proportional relationship between fin length and body length. Find the power function \\(F = k L^p\\) that fits this data. Do the fin lengths increase faster, slower or at the same rate as the body lengths? How do you know? 8.2.4 Specific heat The specific heat \\(s\\) of an element is the number of calories of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of the element by one degree Celcius. Use the following data to decide if \\(s\\) is proportional or inversely proportional to the atomic weight \\(w\\). Then find the function \\(s(w)\\). Element Li Mg Al Fe Ag Pb Hg weight \\(w\\) (g/mol) 6.9 24.3 27.0 55.8 107.9 207.2 200.6 specific heat \\(s\\) (cal) 0.92 0.25 0.21 0.11 0.056 0.031 0.033 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
