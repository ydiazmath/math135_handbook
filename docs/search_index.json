Estimate what you don’t know! Ask a series of smaller questions. Estimate the answers to the smaller questions. Multiply and pay attention to units. Remember, we’re trying to estimate! Do not obsess over details, but also, Do not guess blindly. Find a middle ground! Pro Tip #1: Identify smaller problems that you can estimate using your everyday common sense. For example, rather than estimating the height of of a building, I would estimate the height of one floor and estimate the number of floors, and then multiply. Pro Tip #2: When estimating, determine the order of magnitude (10, 100, 1000, etc). Use the geometric mean when you think the answer is somewhere in between. For example, if you think 1,000 is too small but that 10,000 is too big, then use 3,000. 14.2 Some Useful Data The following approximate data may be useful in various Fermi problems. Each has been stated with one or two significant figures. Population of the world: \\(7 \\times 10^9\\) people Population of the United States: \\(3 \\times 10^8\\) people Average human life span worldwide (in years): 71 years United States national debt (in dollars): \\(\\$1.8 \\times 10^{13}\\) United States federal spending (in dollars per year): \\(\\$3.8 \\times 10^{12}\\). Fraction of United States federal spending devoted to defense (as a decimal): 0.16 Fraction of United States federal spending devoted to Medicare/Medicaid (as a decimal): 0.27 Radius of earth (in km): 6400 km Acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth: \\(9.8 \\text{ m/}\\text{s}^2\\) Fraction of Earth’s surface covered by water (as a decimal): 0.7 Density of water at sea level: \\(1 \\text{ g}/\\text{cm}^3\\) 14.3 Activities How many blades of grass are there on a football field? How many babies are born each day? It will be helpful to know that (a) there are 7.8 billion people on the planet, (b) the average life expectancy is 73 years, and (c) the population doesn’t change that much (relatively speakiing) in one year. If all 7.8 billion humans in the world were crammed together, how much area would we require? Is this closer to the size of a city, a state, the U.S., or North America? Start by figuring out how many people would fit in 1 square meter. Then figure out how many square kilometers we would need.
