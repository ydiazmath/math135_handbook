Line with slope \\(m\\) and vertical intercept \\(b\\) \\[y = mx + b\\] Line with slope \\(m\\) and containing point \\((a,b)\\) \\[ (y-b) = m (x-a)\\] Line that contains points \\((a_1,b_1)\\) and \\((a_2,b_2)\\) \\[ (y-b_1) = \\frac{b_2 - b_1}{a_2 - a_1} (x - a_1)\\] 5.3 Activities 5.3.1 Graph of a linear function Find the equation \\(y=mx+b\\) for the graph shown below. 5.3.2 Height and weight of American men The table below lists the average weight, \\(w\\), in pounds of American men in their sixties for height, \\(h\\), in inches. Height (inches) 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 Weight (pounds) 166 171 176 181 186 191 196 201 Which is the dependent variable and which is the independent variable? Is this an increasing function or a decreasing function? Can this be represented by a linear function? If so, find an equation to describe this data. 5.3.3 Scooter rates A scooter company charges for monthly service according to the formula: \\[C(t) = 5.99 + 0.23 t\\] where \\(t\\) is the number of minutes minutes ridden. Find and interpret the rate of change and the vertical intercept. 5.3.4 Oil reserves There were 1650 billion barrels of proven oil reserves in the world as of 2016. At constant consumption levels (and excluding unproven reserves), the world had enough oil to last about 47 more years beyond 2016. Create a linear function \\(R(t)\\) that models the oil reserves (in billions of barrels) where \\(t\\) is the number of years since 2016. Find and interpret the rate of change and the vertical intercept of your function. 5.4 Solutions 5.4.1 Graph of a linear function The slope is \\[ m = \\frac{-5 - 5}{15 - 0} = \\frac{-10}{15}= - \\frac{2}{3}\\] so the formula is \\[ y = - \\frac{2}{3} x + 5\\] Here we have chosen the two points \\((0,5)\\) and \\((15,-5)\\) to find our slope. The first point has an \\(x\\)-value of \\(0\\), so its \\(y\\)-value is equal to \\(b\\). 5.4.2 Height and weight of American men Height is the independent variable (input) and weight is the dependent variable (output) Increasing. Yes, because we have a constant rate of change. The slope is \\(\\frac{171-166}{69-68}=5\\) so the equation is \\[ w - 166 = 5 (h-68) \\] which is the same as \\[ w = 5h - 174. \\] 5.4.3 Scooter rates The vertical intercept is \\(\\$5.99\\). This is the base monthly fee for the service. The rate of change is \\(0.23\\) dollars per minutes. This is the “per minute” usage rate for riding a scooter. Note that there is no “unlocking” fee in this plan. If there was an unlocking fee, then we would need a second input variable: the number of times that the scooter is ridden. 5.4.4 Oil reserves We use all 1650 barrels in 47 years, so we have the initial point \\((0,1650)\\) and another point \\((47,0)\\). The first point uses that 2016 corresponds to the input value of \\(0\\) and the second point interprets the fact that all of the oil reserves are used in the 47 years. To find the slope, we can do \\(\\frac{0-1650}{47-0}=-35.11\\). The formula is \\[ B(t) = - 35.11t+ 1650.\\] The rate of change is 35.11 billions of barrels per year. This is the annual consumption of oil. The vertical intercept is 1650 barrels. This is the amount of oil reserves in 2016.
