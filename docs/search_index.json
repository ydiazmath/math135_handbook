[["sir-model-1.html", "40 SIR Model 40.1 The SIR Model for the Spread of Disease 40.2 Activities", " 40 SIR Model 40.1 The SIR Model for the Spread of Disease In the SIR Model the population is partitioned into three categories: Susceptible, Infected and Removed (or Recovered). There are two parameters: The infection rate \\(a\\) The removal rate \\(b\\) Here are the three differential equations that make up the SIR Model \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= -a \\,S\\, I \\\\ \\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= a \\, S\\, I - b \\, I \\\\ \\frac{dR}{dt} &amp;= b \\, I \\end{align}\\] 40.1.1 Plotting an SIR Slope Field and an SIR Trajectory The mosaicCalc package has a vectorfield_plot function that we use to create a slope field, and a traj_plot function that we use to plot a trajectory. So we need to make sure that this package has been loaded into RStudio. suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mosaicCalc)) Here is some example code that plots an SIR slope field where The infection rate is \\(a=0.001\\) The removal rate is \\(b=0.2\\) \\(0 \\leq S \\leq 800\\) \\(0 \\leq I \\leq 100\\) The horizontal axis is the susceptible population and the vertical axis is the infected population. vectorfield_plot(S ~ - 0.001*S*I, I ~ 0.001*S*I -0.2*I, bounds(S=0:800, I=0:100), transform=function(L) L^0.01) Here is some example code that plots a single SIR trajectory for this same model. Here are the additional inputs: domain(t=0:80) means that the trajectory runs for \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 80\\). S=800 means that the initial susceptible population is 800. I=5 means that the initial infected population is 5. nt=20 means that 20 tick marks will be added to the trajectory, showing the time that the point \\((S,I)\\) occurs. SIRdyn = makeODE(dS ~ - 0.001*S*I, dI ~ 0.001*S*I -0.2*I ) Soln = integrateODE(SIRdyn, domain(t=0:80), S=800, I=5) traj_plot(I(t) ~ S(t), Soln, nt=20) ## Solution containing functions S(t), I(t). 40.2 Activities 40.2.1 Threshold Population for an SIR Model Here is the slope field for an SIR Model. The horizontal axis is the Susceptible population and the vertical axis is the Infected population. If we start at \\(S=200\\) and \\(I=30\\), are we in epidemic phase? If we start at \\(S=400\\) and \\(I=10\\), are we in epidemic phase? What is the threshold population for this SIR Model? 40.2.2 Ending an Outbreak Before Everyone Gets Sick A disease is spreading according to the SIR Model \\[ \\frac{dS}{dt} = -0.001 SI \\qquad \\frac{dS}{dt} = 0.001 SI -0.2 I \\] 1. Use traj_plot to create the SI trajectory for initial conditions \\(S=600\\) and \\(I=8\\). Start with \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 100.\\) 2. How long does the outbreak last? Answer this question by lowering the upper bound on \\(t\\) to find the first time where \\(I=0\\). 3. Now increase the removal rate \\(b=0.2\\) to find the smallest value of \\(b\\) such that when the outbreak is over, there are at least 200 susceptible people who never became infected. Your answer should be correct up to two decimal places. 40.2.3 Managing an Outbreak The peak Infected population always occurs at the threshold population \\[ S = \\frac{b}{a}. \\] If \\(S &gt; b/a\\) then the infected population is increasing, and we are in epidemic phase. What are some strategies for getting out of epidemic phase? What effect do these strategies have on the parameters our S-I-R Model? Does this action change the infection rate \\(a\\)? Change the removal rate \\(b\\)? Or something else? 40.2.4 Changing Infection Rate Versus Changing Removal Rate Use traj_plot to create a trajectory for the SIR Model \\[ \\frac{dS}{dt} = -0.001 SI \\qquad \\frac{dS}{dt} = 0.001 SI -0.2 I \\] starting at \\(S=600\\) and \\(I=8\\) and \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 50\\). How large is the peak infected population? When does it occur? How many uninfected people are there at the end of the outbreak? Now let’s change the model to be half as infectious: \\[ \\frac{dS}{dt} = -0.0005 SI \\qquad \\frac{dS}{dt} = 0.0005 SI -0.2 I \\] and starting at \\(S=600\\) and \\(I=8\\). Plot this trajectory. How large is the peak infected population? When does it occur? How many uninfected people are there at the end of the outbreak? How long does the outbreak last? Now let’s change the original model by doubling the removal time: \\[ \\frac{dS}{dt} = -0.001 SI \\qquad \\frac{dS}{dt} = 0.001 SI -0.4 I \\] and starting at \\(S=600\\) and \\(I=8\\). Plot this trajectory. How large is the peak infected population? When does it occur? How many uninfected people are there at the end of the outbreak? How long does the outbreak last?
