Time 8 am 9 10 11 noon 1 pm 2 3 4 5 pm Amount 0.15 0.17 0.2 0.45 0.48 0.75 1.03 1.20 1.45 1.60 What was the average rate of rainfall from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.? What are the units of this rate of change? 6.2.3 Sketching a function Sketch a nonlinear function that has an average rate of change of 1 on the interval \\([0,2]\\). Compare sketches at your table. Are they similar? Sketch a function with an AROC of 1 on \\([0,2]\\) that is very different from everyone elseâ€™s function. The take away: AROC is an estimation of the behavior of the function on the interval. But there is no guarantee about the quality of the estimate. 6.2.4 Slope and Concavity Sketch an example of a function that is Increasing and concave up Increasing and concave down Decreasing and concave up Decreasing and concave down 6.2.5 Example Function Here is the graph of a function. Find the subintervals of \\([0,10]\\) where the function is Increasing Decreasing Concave up Concave down 6.2.6 Vinyl LPs Let \\(V(t)\\) denote the number of vinyl LP records sold in the US (in millions) in year \\(t\\). \\[ \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c} t &amp; 1995 &amp; 2000 &amp; 2005 &amp; 2010 &amp; 2015 &amp; 2020 \\\\ \\hline V(t) &amp; 0.8 &amp; 1.5 &amp; 0.9 &amp; 2.8 &amp; 11.9 &amp; 27.5 \\end{array} \\] Calculate the average rate of change for each of the five year intervals 1995-2000, 2000-2005, 2005-2010, 2010-15, 2015-2020. Use your answers from part 1 to determine whether the function \\(V(t)\\) is increasing or decreasing on these five year intervals. Use your answers from part 1 to estimate whether the function \\(V(t)\\) is concave up or concave down at each of the points 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. 6.2.7 Relative change of the Dow Jones average The relative change of a function \\(f(x)\\) on interval \\([a,b]\\) is \\[ \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{f(a)}.\\] What is the relative change in the Dow Jones average from 169.84 to 77.90 (from 1 January 1931 to 31 December 1931)? Compare this to the relative change in the Dow Jones average from 35,443.82 to 35369.09 (from 2 September 2021 to 3 September 2021).
