# 1.B Linear Functions

## Goals

-   Explain linear functions in words, tables, equations, and graphs
-   Describe the effects of varying parameters in linear functions
-   Assess whether given data is linear and, if so, model it with a
    function

## Linear Funtions

Here are three ways to write a linear function, depending on the
information that you have.

-   Line with slope $m$ and vertical intercept $b$ $$y = mx + b$$
-   Line with slope $m$ and containing point $(a,b)$
    $$ (y-b) = m (x-a)$$
-   Line that contains points $(a_1,b_1)$ and $(a_2,b_2)$
    $$ (y-b_1) = \frac{b_2 - b_1}{a_2 - a_1} (x - a_1)$$

## Activities

### Height and weight of American men

The table below lists the average weight, $w$, in pounds of American men
in their sixties for height, $h$, in inches.

| **Height (inches)** | 68  | 69  | 70  | 71  | 72  | 73  | 74  | 75  |
|---------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **Weight (pounds)** | 166 | 171 | 176 | 181 | 186 | 191 | 196 | 201 |

1.  Which is the dependent variable and which is the independent
    variable?\
2.  Is this an increasing function or a decreasing function?
3.  Can this be represented by a linear function? If so, find an
    equation to describe this data.

### Scooter rates

A scooter company charges for monthly service according to the formula:
$$C(t) =  5.99 + 0.23 t$$ where $t$ is the number of minutes minutes
ridden.

Find and interpret the rate of change and the vertical intercept.

### Oil reserves

There were 1650 billion barrels of proven oil reserves in the world as
of 2016. At constant consumption levels (and excluding unproven
reserves), the world had enough oil to last about 47 more years beyond
2016.

1.  Create a linear function $R(t)$ that models the oil reserves (in
    *billions* of barrels) where $t$ is the number of years since 2016.
2.  Find and interpret the rate of change and the vertical intercept of
    your function.

### World population growth rate
The plot below represents the world population growth rate by year since 1995. 

```{r}
Y=c(0,5,10,15,20)
R=c(1.41,1.26,1.20,1.13,1.06)
plotPoints(R~Y,main="World Population Growth Rate",xlab="Year (since 1995)",ylab="Growth Rate")
```

1. Explain why a linear model of this data is reasonable.
2. Come up with an equation that (approximately) describes this data.
3. What decision(s) did you make in part (b)? What are the strengths and weaknesses of your choice? 
4. Create a plot in RStudio that shows both the data points and the linear function that you found in part (b). 
      - Start by doing a cut-and-paste the R code above
      - You can add your linear function to this plot using `plotFun(m*t+b~t,add=TRUE)` where `m` and `b` are the slope and the vertical intercept of the function you found in part (b)

## Solutions

### Graph of a linear function

The slope is
$$ m = \frac{-5 - 5}{15 - 0} = \frac{-10}{15}= - \frac{2}{3}$$ so the
formula is $$ y = - \frac{2}{3} x + 5$$

Here we have chosen the two points $(0,5)$ and $(15,-5)$ to find our slope. The first point has an $x$-value of $0$, so its $y$-value is equal to $b$.

### Height and weight of American men

1.  Height is the independent variable (input) and weight is the
    dependent variable (output)
2.  Increasing.
3.  Yes, because we have a constant rate of change. The slope is
    $\frac{171-166}{69-68}=5$ so the equation is $$
    w - 166 = 5 (h-68)
    $$ which is the same as $$
    w = 5h - 174.
    $$

### Scooter rates

-   The vertical intercept is $\$5.99$. This is the base monthly fee for the
    service.
-   The rate of change is $0.23$ dollars per minutes. This is the "per
    minute" usage rate for riding a scooter.

Note that there is no "unlocking" fee in this plan. If there was an
unlocking fee, then we would need a **second** input variable: the
number of times that the scooter is ridden.

### Oil reserves

1.  We use all 1650 barrels in 47 years, so we have the initial point $(0,1650)$ and another point $(47,0)$. The first point uses that 2016 corresponds to the input value of $0$ and the second point interprets the fact that all of the oil reserves are used in the 47 years. To find the slope, we can do $\frac{0-1650}{47-0}=-35.11$. The formula is $$ B(t) =  - 35.11t+ 1650.$$

2.  The rate of change is 35.11 billions of barrels per year. This is
    the annual consumption of oil. The vertical intercept is 1650
    barrels. This is the amount of oil reserves in 2016.
