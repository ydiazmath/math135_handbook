### Average Value

The average value of a function $f(x)$ on interval $[a,b]$ is given by
$$ \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx.$$

Find the average value of function    on the given interval.

### Modeling Population Growth

The second phase of bacteria growth is called the *log phase*. The rate of population growth is proportional to the number of bacteria at that time with proportionality constant 0.003. In other words

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.003 P
$$

This is equivalent to the integration formula
$$
\int \frac{1}{P} \, dP = \int 0.003 \, dt.
$$

1. Integrate both sides of this equation and find a general equation for $P$. 
2.  Suppose there are 1000 bacteria initially. Find the specific equation for $P$. 


### Zombie Apocalypse

where $t$ is the number of days since the start of the outbreak.

1. Write the number of infected people $I(T)$ as an indefinite integral.
2.  How many total people get infected by time $T$ where $T$ is a very large number?

1. $\frac{3}{5}x^5 + C$
2. $\frac{1}{6}r^6 + \frac{7}{2}r^{-2} + \frac{4}{7}r^{7/4}+C$

10. $-350 e^{-0.02t} + 4\ln t + C$

### Definite Integral Practice

We solve each of these using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. If $F'(x)=f(x)$ then
$$
\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a).
$$

1. We have
\begin{align}
\int_{-2}^5 x^2 \,dx &=& \left. \frac{1}{3}x^3  \right|_{-2}^5 = \frac{125}{3} + \frac{8}{3} = \frac{133}{3}. 
\end{align}



2. We have
\begin{align}
\int_0^{\pi/4} \sin(x) + e^{x}\,dx &= \left. -\cos(x) + e^x \right|_0^{\pi/4} = -\cos(\pi/4) + e^{\pi/4} - (-\cos(0) + e^0)  \\
&= -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + e^{\pi/4} - (-1+1) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + e^{\pi/4}.
\end{align}


3. We have
\begin{align}
\int_1^e 4t + \frac{1}{4t} \,dt &=& \left. 2t^2 + \frac{1}{4} \ln(t) \right|_1^e = 2e^2 + \frac{1}{4} \ln(e^2) - \left( 2e^0 + \frac{1}{4} \ln(1) \right) \\
&=& 2e^2 + \frac{1}{2} - 2 - 0 = 2e^2 + \frac{3}{2}
\end{align}

### Area Between Curves

Find the area enclosed by the curves $f(x)=5-x^2$ and $g(x)=x^2-3$ by following the steps below

1. Setting $f(x)=g(x)$ gives $5-x^2=x^2-3$ which means that $x^2=4$. So the curves  intersect at $x=\pm 2$.
2. On the interval $[-2, 2]$, function $f(x)$ is above function $g(x)$.
3. The area between these curves is
$$
\int_{-2}^{2} ( f(x) -g(x)) dx
=
\int_{-2}^{2} ( 8 -2x^2) dx
$$
4. Let's use RStudio. It's easier!

```{r}
f=makeFun(8 - 2*x^2 ~ x)
a = -2 
b = 2 
num = 100000
### the approximation of f(x) on interval [a,b]
base = (b-a)/num
points = seq(from=a+base, to=b, by=base)
heights = f(points)
areas = base*heights
sum(areas)
```


### Average Value

1. The average value of $\sin(x)$ on $[0, \pi]$ is
$$
\frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{\pi} \sin(x) dx =
\left. - \frac{1}{\pi}  \cos(x) \right|_{0}^{\pi}
= - \frac{1}{\pi} (\cos(\pi) - \cos(0))
= \frac{2}{\pi}
$$
2. The average value of $e^{2x}$ on $[0,5]$ is
$$
\frac{1}{5} \int_0^{5} e^{2x} dx =
\left.  \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{2} e^{2x} \right|_{0}^{5}
= \frac{1}{10} (e^{10} - 1)
$$
3. The average value of $x^2 + 3$ on $[4,6]$ is

$$
\frac{1}{6-4} \int_4^{6} (x^2 + 3) dx = \left.  \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{3} x^3 + 3x \right) \right|_{4}^{6} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{6^3}{3} + 18 -  \frac{4^3}{3} - 12 \right)= 28.33
$$

### Modeling Population Growth

The second phase of bacteria growth is called the \emph{log phase}. The rate of population growth is proportional to the number of bacteria at that time with proportionality constant 0.003. In other words

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.003 P
$$

This is equivalent to the integration formula
$$
\int \frac{1}{P} \, dP = \int 0.003 \, dt.
$$

1. Integrate both sides of this equation and find a general equation for $P$. 

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
\int \frac{1}{P} \, dP &=& \int 0.003 \, dt \\
\ln(P) &=& 0.003t + C \\
P &=& K e^{0.003t}
\end{array}
$$

where $K = e^C$.

2.  We know that $P(t) = K e^{0.003t}$ and that $P(0)=1000$. This means that $K=1000$. So our function is
$$
P(t) = 1000 e^{0.003t}.
$$


### Zombie Apocalypse

The **rate** $r(t)$ at which people become zombies during the inevitable zombie apocalypse can be approximated by 
$$ r(t)=1000 e^{-0.5t}$$
where $T$ is the number of days since the start of the outbreak.

1. The number of infected people is
$$I(T) = \int_0^T r(t) \, dt = \int_0^T 1000 e^{-0.5t} \, dt$$

2.  We have
$$
\int_0^T 1000 e^{-0.5t} \, dt = \left. \frac{1000}{-0.5} e^{-0.5t} \right|_0^T = - \frac{1000}{0.5} e^{-0.5 T} + \frac{1000}{0.5} e^{0} = 2000 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{e^{0.5 T}}\right).
$$
For very large $T$ the second term is basically 0. So we have 2000 zombies by the end of the outbreak. Gosh, that's not too bad!
